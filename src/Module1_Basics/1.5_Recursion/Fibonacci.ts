/*
Print Fibonacci Series up to Nth term

Problem Statement: Given an integer N. Print the Fibonacci series up to the Nth term.

Examples:

Example 1:
Input: N = 5
Output: 0 1 1 2 3 5
Explanation: 0 1 1 2 3 5 is the fibonacci series up to 5th term.(0 based indexing)

Example 2:
Input: 6

Output: 0 1 1 2 3 5 8
Explanation: 0 1 1 2 3 5 8 is the fibonacci series upto 6th term.(o based indexing)

  for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    console.log(fibonacci(i));
  }
};

const fibonacci = (n: number): number => {
  if (n <= 1) {
    return n;
  }
  return fibonacci(n - 1) + fibonacci(n - 2);
};
